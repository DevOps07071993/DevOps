# Installing Docker on Amazon Linux server
1. Amazon Linux EC2 Instance
2. Install docker and start docker services
   yum install docker -y
   docker --version   
# start docker services
   service docker start
   service docker status
3. Create a user called dockeradmin
   useradd dockeradmin
   passwd dockeradmin
4. add a user to docker group to manage docker 
   usermod -aG docker dockeradmin
### Validation test
5. Create a tomcat docker container by pulling a docker image from the public docker registry
   docker run -d --name test-tomcat-server -p 8090:8080 tomcat:latest
How to create Docker container?
To create a docker container we need a docker image with the help of docker image we can run the command called docker run with some additional specifications to create a docker container
Now how do we get this docker image?
Docker image we an get it in 2 ways. They are:
(1)Dockerhub ->It is a public repository which contains the docker images we can use the command called "docker  pull" to take the image on to our local repository.
(2)Creating our own Dockerfile - pull the basic image from dockerhub on top of that we can do own customization with the help of Dockerfile.
	- Dockerfile contains instructions what your docker container should do to create a docker image out of dockerfile we are going to use docker build command.

	tomcat - pull latest basic image form dockerhub and create a customization container on top of it
Unable to launch container in browser will see below troubleshooting issue:-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because it is looking inside container webapp folder but originally its located on webapps.dist folder (all files)
Inside container -> Inside webapps.dist folder - "cp -R * ../webapps/"

Here will get the same issue on every new tomcat container. To overcome this issue will do with Dockerfile below,
Write first dockerfile?
----------------------
FROM: To pull the base image
RUN: To execute shell commands
CMD: To provides default for an executing container at the time of execution container (OVERWRITTEN)
ENTRYPOINT: To configure a container that will run as an executable (NOT OVERWRITTEN)
WORKDIR:To switch the directory inside the cotainer
COPY: copy a directory from local host to docker container
ADD: copy files and folders from local machine to docker containers and also using wget command to download any of the packages form browser
EXPOSE: Informs docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime (insode the container application running some port number those applications are exposing to external network)
ENV: To set envirnemnt variables

vi Dockerfile:
FROM spack/centos7
RUN yum install java -y
RUN mkdir /opt/tomcat
WORKDIR /opt/tomcat
ADD https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.14/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.14.tar.gz .
RUN tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-10.1.14.tar.gz
RUN mv apache-tomcat-10.1.14/* /opt/tomcat
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["/opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh", "run"]

FROM spack/centos7
RUN yum install java -y
RUN mkdir /opt/tomcat
WORKDIR /opt/tomcat
#If we will use RUN Instruction will go and add wget but ADD Instruction no need to add any wget directly will add the url
ADD https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.14/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.14.tar.gz .
RUN tar -xvzf apache-tomcat-10.1.14.tar.gz
RUN mv apache-tomcat-10.1.14/* /opt/tomcat
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["/opt/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh", "run"]

docker build -t tomcat .
