Currently application team is using Jenkins for build and deployment like complete administartion access. But here we should go to ansible for deployment.
Ansible as a deployment tool.
Dockerhub
Note: Non-Containerized applications means which we can deploy directly on to the VM here we can use Nexus or Artifactory
Jenkins is going to take the code from github and build artifacts and copy those artifacts in to ansible server.Ansibe task is to create the images and deploy the containers.
Ansible is going to take the artifact and with the help of docker file create docker image we can push image it in to the dockerhub and docker pull that image and deploy it in to container
 Install AnsibleServer:
----------------------
Setup EC2 Instance
Setup hostname
Create ansadmin user
Add user to sudoers file
Generate ssh keys
Enable password based login
Install ansible
  useradd ansadmin
  passwd ansadmin
  visudo - Add (ansadmin        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL) - I can execute any command with out any password
  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config  -  (Need to enable password based authentication "PasswordAuthentication 'yes'")  
  service sshd reload
  sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
  python --version
  ansible --version
  vi /etc/ansible/hosts - Add dockerhosts private IP)
Note: Bydefault amazon linux comes with the python
Login with ansadmin user:
  ssh-keygen
  cd /home/ansadmin/.ssh/ - will see private keys and public keys
  cd .ssh/
  ssh-copy-id 172.31.16.83(dockerhost ip) - Adding ansible ssh keys to docker
    O/P: Number of key(s) added: 1
  ansible all -m ping
    O/P: 172.31.16.83 | SUCCESS => {
          "ansible_facts": {
          "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
          },
          "changed": false,
          "ping": "pong"
        }

We need to prepare ansible system to create docker images:
---------------------------------------------------------
Integrate Docker with Ansible:
-----------------------------
Add dockerhost to ansible as a managed node so that ansible control node can able to manage our dockerhost
Playbook to tell to dockerhost how to create container

Dockerhost steps:
----------------
Create ansadmin
Add ansadmin to sudoers file
Enable password based login
Ansible Node:
------------
Add to hosts file
Copy ssh keys (path is cd /.ssh)
Test the connection

Integrate ansible with Jenkins:
------------------------------
Jenkins can able to copy artifacts to ansible and ansible to create image and deploy containers to docker host.
Go to ManageJenkins - configuresystem - Add ansibleserver host details

Create TestJob - Send build artifacts over SSH - Choose AnsibleServer  - Create /opt/docker under ansible system using ansadminuser - Trigger the build (It should copy war file in to ansible /opt/docker path)
Now ansible job is going to create the image using webapp.war file and push it in to dockerhub repository.
Install docker on ansible system (under ansadmin user)
  sudo yum install docker -y
  cat /etc/group (Here you are able to see docker group)
Now you should ansadmin to the dockergroup then only we an execute docker commands as ansadmin otherwise it will throw errors.
  sudo usermod -aG docker ansadmin
  id ansadmin
  service docker status
  sudo service docker start
  sudo service docker status
    vi Dockerfile
        # Pull base image
        From tomcat:8-jre8
        RUN cp -R /usr/local/tomcat/webapps.dist/* /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
        COPY ./*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
   sudo docker build -t regapp .
   docker images
   sudo docker ps -a
   sudo docker images
   docker run -d --name regapp-container -p 8083:8080 regapp
   sudo docker run -d --name regapp-container -p 8083:8080 regapp
   docker ps -a
   sudo docker ps -a
Here everything its happened manually.Now will do automate using ansible playbooks.
Here Jenkins send artifacts to ansible server but need to deploy on docker container how?
  First will push image to dockerhub and here ansible will tell to dockercontainer is please go and pull image from dockerhub and deploy using ansible playbook.
Create ansible playbook to create docker image:
